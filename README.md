# MyPie

This project shows a simple radial pie menu that appears around the mouse cursor
when the `1` key is pressed. The menu uses Electron for the UI and an
AutoHotkey script to trigger the window on Windows systems.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the AutoHotkey script `showMenu.ahk`.
3. Press the `1` key and a menu appears at the mouse location. Click anywhere or
   press `Esc` to close it.

Icons for the menu are loaded from the `assets` folder included in this repo.
